Leaving this navigation json in case I need to bring back flyout menus. 

The code in Header.html I'll leave it intact.

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
When I joined CurrencyFair, I started as the sole designer, responsible for fixing and improving the user experience of the company’s web app. At the time, CurrencyFair did not have a mobile app, and the existing web app only worked on desktop, without responsive functionality. My initial focus was to make the web app work across all screen sizes, improving accessibility for users on mobile devices.
</p>

<p><strong>Screens to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A before-and-after comparison of the web app's desktop and responsive design (showing how the web app was adapted for mobile screens).</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Shift to Mobile</h2>
<p>
After a few years of working on the core product, and following several rounds of investment, CurrencyFair was finally ready to build its mobile app. As the lead designer on this project, I was responsible for creating the app's user experience from the ground up, focusing initially on iOS. 
</p>
<p>
With limited resources, we outsourced the development to an agency. I took on the role of managing the interaction with the agency, ensuring timelines were met and coordinating closely with our Head of Product. This involved frequent updates, feedback loops, and revisions to ensure the app met our users' needs and expectations.
</p>

<p><strong>Screens to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Early wireframes or design concepts for the iOS app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>App Launch and Customer Feedback</h2>
<p>
The app was officially launched in the Apple Store near midnight on a Friday, a milestone celebrated by the entire team. The launch marked a significant achievement for the company, and initial customer feedback was highly positive. The app filled a long-standing gap, offering our users the convenience of managing their transactions on the go.
</p>
<p>
However, with the increase in mobile users, we began gathering feedback to improve the experience and add new features. Continuous improvement became a priority.
</p>

<p><strong>Screens to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Screens of the iOS app’s launch UI or celebratory moments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tackling User Frustrations: Authentication Flow</h2>
<p>
One of the first major user complaints came from the login and authentication process. Initially, the app mirrored the web app’s login flow, which required a username, password, two-factor authentication, and a PIN. On desktop, this made sense for security, but on mobile, it became cumbersome and frustrating for users.
</p>
<p>
After collecting feedback and recognizing the need for a more seamless experience, I researched competitor solutions and proposed a new flow using PIN and TouchID for a more intuitive and secure mobile login. Once I got approval from the Head of Product and CTO, I worked closely with the development agency to implement these changes, significantly improving the user experience.
</p>

<p><strong>Screens to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Before-and-after screens of the login process (username/password/2FA vs. PIN and TouchID).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Simplifying the Sign-up Process</h2>
<p>
Another challenge was the sign-up process. Due to regulatory requirements and Anti Money Laundering (AML) compliance, we had to ask users a lengthy series of questions when they signed up. The original solution simply loaded the desktop sign-up flow into the mobile app, which frustrated users with a tedious process.
</p>
<p>
To improve this, I gathered customer feedback and redesigned the sign-up experience for mobile. The new flow broke the process into manageable chunks, allowed users to save their progress, and even influenced improvements in the desktop experience.
</p>

<p><strong>Screens to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The original vs. redesigned sign-up flow (especially highlighting the step-by-step progression and save functionality).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Learnings</h2>
<p>
Working on the CurrencyFair mobile app taught me the nuances of mobile UX, especially the importance of adapting desktop-first experiences to mobile users' needs. It also emphasized the need for continuous user feedback and iteration, as well as a deep understanding of security and compliance in fintech.
</p>

<p><strong>Screens to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A final overview of the current iOS app, highlighting key user flows such as login, dashboard, and sign-up.</li>
</ul>
