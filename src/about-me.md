      <p>I approach my work pragmatically blending creative ideas with practical steps to achieve tangible outcomes. I believe that getting products earlier on customers hands is the best way to learn and iterate on improvements as insights come to light.</p>
<p>One of my core tenets is posing thought-provoking questions and championing streamlined solutions throughout the design journey. By examining scenarios, drawing inspiration from other sectors, and analyzing hypothetical situations, I help my team and myself gain comprehensive insights into a diverse set of challenges. Prioritizing minimal viable solutions allows us to strike a balance between future design aspirations and current business requirements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I support my colleagues by linking concepts and encouraging them to explore different perspectives. I place great importance on company values and use them as a compass for decision-making.</p>
