<h3>1. What is a cookie?</h3>
<p>Cookies are small data files that are stored in your web browser on your computer, tablet or smartphone (each a Device) when you visit a website. Cookies serve a number of purposes like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, interests or log in details, and generally improving your experience.

You should be able to find more in depth information about opting out of cookies on your browser settings menu.</p>
<h3>2. Do we use cookies?</h3>
<p>Yes, we collect information about your Device, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration which is available to us upon request.
