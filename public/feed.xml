        <div class="container post__container">
<p>The other day, I was chatting with a mate who’s seriously into fitness—especially resistance training. He’s way more experienced than I am, so he's pretty much my go-to guy for advice. We usually end up talking about this stuff for hours, and I often mention how much I use ChatGPT for everything from knowledge to my training plans. I described how ChatGPT helps me set up all my training routines based on my goals, feeding info like:</p>
<ul>
<li>My profile: height, weight, age, body fat percentage</li>
<li>Individualised training plans and goals like building muscle, gaining strength</li>
<li>The type of training and volume I need based on my experience</li>
<li>Nutrition advice, recovery tips,</li>
<li>Plus, the more scientific bits like protein synthesis, the role of testosterone and hormones, the importance of resting and sleep, etc.</li>
<li>Tracking and metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>During this conversation with my friend, I mentioned that I’d like to eventually work with an actual fitness coach. You know, someone who can give me hands-on feedback, check my nutrition, keep me motivated, and push me when lagging behing. Someone that can give me that extra kick in the butt when I need it. That’s when he said, &quot;You know, that’s the one shortcoming with ChatGPT. You having to ask every time” And he’s right.</p>
<p>Imagine if ChatGPT wasn’t just something we had to keep asking for stuff, but instead, it acted like a coach, keeping tabs on us. It could check in on what we’re eating, send reminders about protein intake, or even ask how much we lifted today. Based on our performance, it could give recommendations for next steps, suggest diet tweaks, or offer tips on things we might be missing.</p>

<div class="container post__container">
<p>I haven’t seen anything on the market quite like this—not just for fitness but for anything any other area of your life (I can think of a number of specific things, but I’ll keep it focused on the fitness topic). Imagine if ChatGPT could connect with apps like WhatsApp to provide you updates and being one of the tools you only need to use to manage things, and, have GPT connected to Google Sheets or Airtable to manage training plans with charts and progress visuals. It could log everything in the background, building a database of what we’re doing without us having to think about it.</p>
<p>I’m already doing all this stuff manually and as mentioned, I need to be proactively asking GPT to provide and output things for me, but it’d be brilliant if ChatGPT could handle it all and providing the request for inputs from me and me providing the outputs. It’s got me thinking about the future of AI, where it's less about us prompting  and sitting idle until we need it but more about AI proactively helping us achieve our goals and pushing us further to be better.</p>
<p>If anybody knows of something like this already working, please reach out and let me know.</p>

    <title>Build Solutions Based on Needs,&lt;br&gt; Not on Requests</title>
    <link href="https://www.ivanfrantar.com/notes/build-solutions-based-on-needslessbrgreater-not-on-requests/" />

      <![CDATA[
        <p>In product development, it’s tempting to take customer requests at face value. After all, who knows better than the customer what they want? However, a common pitfall emerges when features are built blindly based on these requests, only for them to go largely unused. This disconnect reveals a critical insight: what customers ask for isn’t always what they actually need. Needless to say, this also has a cost to the company that didn't yield any benefit to the customer and the overall product.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a situation where a group of customers requests a detailed dashboard feature for tracking various metrics. On the surface, this seems like a clear request that should be fulfilled. However, after the dashboard is built, the product team notices that usage is low. Despite the initial enthusiasm, customers aren’t engaging with the dashboard as expected.</p>
<p>Digging deeper, the team realizes that what customers really needed wasn’t a complex dashboard, but a simpler way to access key metrics quickly, perhaps through periodic summary reports or alerts sent directly to them. The original request for a dashboard was an attempt by customers to articulate a need they felt but didn’t fully understand—what they truly wanted was easier access to information, not another tool to manage.</p>
<p>From a UX perspective, this example highlights the importance of focusing on underlying needs rather than simply fulfilling feature requests. While customer feedback is crucial, it’s up to UX practitioners to dig deeper and identify the real opportunities for improvement that might not be immediately obvious from what customers say.</p>
<p>By focusing on these underlying needs, teams can avoid the trap of building unnecessary features that don’t truly add value. Instead, they can create solutions that are not only used but are indispensable to the customer’s experience. This approach ensures that the time and resources invested in development lead to meaningful improvements, rather than just checking off items on a feature request list.</p>
<p>In the end, the goal is to build products that solve real problems and meet genuine needs. It’s about moving beyond what customers ask for and delivering what they actually require to achieve their goals. By prioritizing needs over requests, teams can create products that are truly valuable, ensuring long-term success, customer satisfaction and a meaningful relationship with your product.</p>

      <![CDATA[
        <p>In today's fast-paced digital landscape, staying ahead of the curve is crucial for product and UX designers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword; it’s a transformative force that can significantly enhance the design process, improve user experiences, and streamline workflows. As the role of designers keeps constantly evolving, one question comes to mind: Should we expect our roles or job titles evolving to become AIX Designer or AIX Product Designers? I don't know for sure, but I wouldn't be surprised to see soon enough in job ads these type of candidates. In the meantime, here's an overview of how AI is affecting our space and how exiting things are becoming.</p>
<h4>Enhanced User Research and Insights</h4>
<p>One of the most time-consuming aspects of UX design is conducting user research and analyzing the data. AI can help by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automating Data Collection:</strong> AI-powered tools can gather and analyze vast amounts of user data from various sources like social media, surveys, and user feedback. This helps designers gain a deeper understanding of user needs and preferences without spending countless hours on manual research. Some examples of tools that come to mind with great capabilities <a href="https://www.hotjar.com">Hotjar</a> and <a href="https://www.lookback.com">Lookback</a>. Another I recently learned about <a href="https://monkeylearn.com/">MonkeyLearn</a> providing interesting insights and visualization of your data.</li>
</ul>
<div class="container-sm mb-3 mb-5">
  <iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFRy785ysJA?si=Q_t8wfX_uxhIbp3B" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Behavior Analysis:</strong> AI can track and analyze user behavior in real-time, providing insights into how users interact with products. This enables designers to identify pain points and areas for improvement more quickly and accurately. Three I'm familiar with <a href="https://www.mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a>, <a href="https://amplitude.com">Amplitude</a> and <a href="https://vwo.com/">VWO</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Personalized User Experiences</h4>
<p>Personalization is key to enhancing user engagement. AI can assist in creating highly personalized experiences by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> By analyzing user data, AI can predict what users are likely to want or need next. This allows designers to create tailored experiences that feel intuitive and responsive to individual users. Some products from <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/">Salesfore AI</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence">IBM</a> and <a href="https://www.heap.io/platform/artificial-intelligence">Heap</a> are packed with incredible features in this area. Another interesting one is <a href="https://www.neuronsinc.com/">Neurons</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Personalization:</strong> AI algorithms can dynamically adjust content based on user preferences and behavior, ensuring that each user gets a unique and relevant experience. Some that I have seen actively used on a number of websites I have come across is <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> and <a href="https://www.persado.com">Persado</a> this latest as an AI tool to generate marketing content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Improved Design Efficiency</h4>
<p>AI can automate repetitive tasks or even overcome the 'blank canvas' syndrome, allowing designers to focus on more creative aspects of their work and spark or bootstrap ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Automated Design Tools:</strong> Common tools we designers use are incorporating incredible AI capabilities to automate mundane design tasks such as resizing images, formatting text, and generating layouts and content. This not only speeds up the design process but also reduces the risk of human error. Some examples, what Figma presented in its latest <a href="https://config.figma.com/">Config Conference 2024</a> with <a href="https://www.figma.com/ai/">Figma AI</a>. Another tool I used quite a bit to generate and brainstorm ideas with teams has also build <a href="https://miro.com/assist/">Miro Assist</a>. <a href="https://canva.com">Canva</a> with their later acquisition of <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/">Affinity</a> it could to be a massive blow to Adobe to the already increadible AI capabilities it has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prototyping and Testing:</strong> AI-driven prototyping tools, although I'm not aware of many options in the AI realm, can quickly generate multiple design variations and test them with users. This accelerates the iterative design process, enabling designers to refine their ideas more rapidly. Figma, as mentioned, can be included in this category. Another interesting one is <a href="https://uizard.io/">Uizard</a> using text prompts to generate prototypes or convertaing hand-drawn designs in to ui designs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Enhanced Creativity and Innovation</h4>
<p>AI can act as a creative buddy, helping you brainstorm new ideas and pushing the boundaries of traditional design:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Generative Design:</strong> AI algorithms can generate a wide range of design options based on a set of parameters defined by the designer. This encourages exploration and experimentation, leading to solutions that might not have been considered otherwise. Interesting tools to generate UI designs quickly is <a href="https://www.usegalileo.ai/explore">Galileo</a> or more in the dev side <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0</a> from <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> and <a href="https://retool.com/products/ai">Retool</a>. Including <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> again in this area. Also for ideation and whiteboarding, I have seem some interesting thing done by <a href="https://www.tldraw.com/">Tldraw.com</a>, have a look at their <a href="https://x.com/tldraw">X feed</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creative Assistance:</strong> AI tools like <a href="https://runwayml.com/">Runway ML</a> generating realistic AI videos and <a href="https://deepai.org/">DeepArt</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/">DALL-E</a> for general art, can assist in creating unique visual styles, graphics, and even complete design concepts; even tools that enhance the quality of your images like <a href="https://letsenhance.io">LetsEnhance</a>. These tools can help designers overcome creative blocks and inspire fresh ideas. In fact, reading a post by Emmet Connolly, VP of Product Design at <a href="https://intercom.com">Intercom</a> explains how they used <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/">Midjourney</a> to generate ideas for the artists they hired to create the illustrations of their newly redesigned website, not to mentioned the brilliant stuff they are already doing with AI, but that's beyond the scope of this note.</p>

</div>
<h4>Optimized User Testing</h4>
<p>User testing is essential for validating design decisions. AI can make this process more efficient and insightful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Automated User Testing:</strong> AI can simulate user interactions and provide detailed feedback on design performance. This allows for extensive testing without the need for large user groups, saving time and resources. <a href="https://maze.co/ai/">Maze</a> is one of the platforms providing unbiased and fast results with AI. <a href="https://www.userlytics.com/user-experience-research/user-experience-platform/ai-ux-analysis/">Userlytics</a> another alternative harnesing the power of AI to better understand businesses users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> AI can analyze user feedback and sentiment from various channels, helping designers understand how users feel about their designs. This provides valuable insights for making user-centric improvements. <a href="https://www.lexalytics.com">Lexalytics</a> is doing interesting work in this area along with <a href="https://altair.com/accelerate-ai-adoption">Altair</a> and <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Data-Driven Decision Making</h4>
<p>AI can boost designers capabilities with data-driven insights, leading to more informed design decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A/B Testing:</strong> AI can automate A/B testing, customer engagement and retention, etc. analyzing the results to determine the most effective design elements. This ensures that design choices are backed by solid data rather than intuition alone. One platform I like, which I'm using in Aerlytix, is <a href="https://posthog.com/docs/ai-engineering">Posthog</a> given that our team is very engineer heavy and Posthog has a great developer experience. Also using it for this site. Although I'm not an Adobe fan I'll include <a href="https://business.adobe.com/products/target/adobe-target.html">Adobe Target</a> as an alternative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong> AI tools can monitor and analyze the performance of designs and web apps in real-time, providing actionable insights for continuous improvement not only for us designer but for developers as well. Many of this platfomrs I listed have common capabilities from the categories I listed. As for performance you'd find apps like <a href="https://hotjar.com">Hotjar</a>, <a href="https://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> and other listed in this note providing great insights. Additionally on the back-end development side, apps like <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> do an amazing job pin-pointing infrastuctural issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The core idea I tried to convey with this article is to highlight that the integration of AI into the product and UX design process is not about replacing designers but augmenting their capabilities. By leveraging AI, designers can gain deeper user insights, create more personalized experiences, enhance efficiency, foster creativity, and make data-driven decisions. As AI technology continues to evolve, its role in design will only grow, opening up new possibilities and setting new standards for excellence in the field. Embracing AI is not just a competitive advantage; it’s a step towards shaping the future of design.</p>
<p class="mb-4">These are exciting times and I, for one, look forward to what AI will bring to our discipline.</p>

    <title>First post after site redesign</title>
    <link href="https://www.ivanfrantar.com/notes/first-post-after-site-redesign/" />
    <updated>2024-07-03T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[
        <p>To baptise this redesign launch, I decided to create a first post to highlight a few of the items behind the decision. This update marks a fresh start not just for the site’s look and feel, but also for how I engage a number of topics or interests I might like to write about.</p>
<p>In the past, I haven’t been very active in writing, often finding myself sharing snippets, reposts, and replies on platforms like X.com (by the way, my user handle is <a href="https://x.com/ifrantar">@ifrantar</a>) and other social networks. However, I’ve decided to be more proactive from the realm of my own website. Moving forward, I’m committing to writing more thoughtful and periodic posts here on my blog. This space will serve as a journal where I can explore and share the things I’m passionate about.</p>
<h3>A few interests I'm into:</h3>
<p><strong>Design and Product Design</strong>: Obviously, as a designer, I’m constantly fascinated by the evolving landscape of design. I’ll be sharing insights, adding more case studies, and my thoughts on the everything related design and product design and development.</p>
<p><strong>AI (who isn't interested these days?)</strong>: Artificial Intelligence, has become an invaluable tool on a daily basis, assisting me in various aspects from coding, research and writing to creating weight lifting programs. It provides precise information on any topic I need to explore, reducing my reliance on traditional search engines like Google. While for topics such as soft skills, politics and other more opinionated areas I'm still not so confident about it (or rather tread more lightly), when it comes to logic and reasoning, it's an amazing tool. I'm super fascinated by it.</p>
<p><strong>Fitness</strong>: I've been doing resistance training for over a year (I know is not that impressive so far), and has become an important aspect of my life. Being a father of two girls, I am committed to staying as fit as possible, not only to be there for them as they grow, but also to ensure that anyone who dares to mess with them thinks twice 😉. So, Expect posts about some workouts, including some PR videos deadlifting, bench pressing, and squats or anything related.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition</strong>: I have learned (or rather I'm learning) how important nutrition is for your fitness goals and your overall health. This area could be boring for some, as I focus on the macronutrients found in the most nutrient-dense whole foods. However it can be exciting if you like steaks (and some other meats) and eggs as much as I do which is 80% of my diet. I might post thousand photos of steaks from slightly different angles. You've been warned (of deliciousness)! Anyway is all about learning as I go.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin and the Concept of Money</strong>: Recently, I’ve started learning about Bitcoin and its broader implications on the concept of money. I'm fascinated by its nature as a protocol operating on a decentralized network using blockchain technology detached from governments, central banks or any country's economy or policy decisions. I look forward to exploring how Bitcoin is reshaping our understanding of money, value, and financial systems.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly where this journey will lead, but that’s part of the excitement. This blog will be a space for me to explore these interests and any new ones that come along. Think of it as a collection of my thoughts and ideas – what I like to call “thought farts.”</p>
<p>If any of these topics are of interest to anybody, or if anyone enjoy reading about random musings, I invite you to follow along. Feel free to get in touch with any feedback or comments you may have. Anyone's insights will be invaluable as I kick start this new journey.</p>
<p>As for this website, under the hood I'm using <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a> and I have decided to use <a href="https://11ty.dev">11ty.dev</a> as the scaffolding to make it work. Both of these platforms are amazing and easy to learn (and I'm still learning the ins and outs). I'll be changing and updating the website design along the journey; the temptation of having this space to do whatever I want is too much.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining me. Stay tuned for more updates, and I look forward to sharing my thoughts and experiences with you all.</p>
